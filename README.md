# Getting Started

## Using the portable mkdocs

Copy the `python` folder into your project.

Now you can run `./python/python.exe -m mkdocs build` and `./python/python.exe -m mkdocs build` in your project directory.

## Update the repo

On a connected device install the required version and architecture of python.

Install mkdocs and mkdocs-material.

Copy the Lib folder and the `python*._pth` file from your python directory.

Now add those to an extracted version of the python embede zip for the same version and architecture. (Overwrite the `python*._pth`).
